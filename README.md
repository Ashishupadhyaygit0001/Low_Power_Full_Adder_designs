# **Why do we need Low-Power VLSI design ?**

Power dissipation of VLSI chips is traditionally a neglected subject. As the scale of integration improves, more transistors, faster and smaller than their predecessors, are being packed into a chip. This leads to the steady growth of the operating frequency and processing capacity per chip, resulting in increased power dissipation. A need for low power VLSI chips arises from such evolution forces of integration circuits.

# **Power Dissipation in CMOS circuits**

There are two types of power dissipation in CMOS circuits: **dynamic** and **static**.

*Dynamic power dissipation* is caused by switching activities of the circuits. A higher operating frequency leads to more frequent switching activities in the circuits and results in increased power dissipation.<br>
*Static power dissipation* is related to the logical states of the circuits rather than switching activities. In CMOS logic, leakage current is the only source of static power dissipation. The various types of leakage currents in CMOS circuits can be gate leakage, subthreshold leakage and drain leakage. The capacitance forms due to parasitic effects of interconnection wires and transistors. Such parasitic capacitance cannot be avoided and it has a significant impact on the power dissipation of the circuits.

# **Designing Full Adders in Cadence Virtuoso**

One of the most elementary arithmetic operations is addition which is substantially and repetitively used in modern computational applications. A 1-bit Full Adder (FA) is considered as the nucleus of binary addition since it is the fundamental cell for building wide word-length adders. Hence, performance enhancement of FA is crucial to the performance improvement of the Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) in the microprocessors. In this project, 4 different types of Full Adder design approaches using TGs and static CMOS logic has been implemented and compared to find the one with lowest PDP value. The FAs were implemented in 180 nm technology using Cadence tools. Further, their corresponding layouts were drawn using Layout-XL of Cadence. Design Rule Checks (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) verifications were done successfully. QRC was run for the layouts designed to account for parasitic effects and were saved in an av-extracted view. A testbench was set up to follow up on the waveforms for inputs and outputs of Full Adders and identified the critical path through worst-case delays and calculated the power dissipation of the full adder cell.


# Transmission Gate Adder

The TGA uses 20 transistors to implement the full adder logic. The output of XOR gate is SUM, while the output of the AND gate is the CARRY. The AND gate produces a high output only when both inputs are high. The XOR gate produces a high output if either input, but not both, is high. The 3-bit full adder circuit has a provision to add the carry generated from the lower bits. 

The schematic of the adder is given below :

# Hybrid 18-T Full Adder (GDI D1)

This Full Adder uses 18 transistors for its logic implementation. The Hybrid FA consists of 3 modules, the first module for Xor/Xnor Gate formation and the other two modules are used to generate CARRY and SUM. Module 1 input is A and B and it perform the Xor/Xnor between two input of input A and B and having the two output Xor and Xnor. Module 2 performs the Xor operation with the input Cin and the output of the module 1. Module 3 works as a 2:1 multiplexer and input carry Cin acts as a select line for this multiplexer and the output of the module 3 is Cout.

# Transmission Full Adder 

The Transmission Full Adder (TFA) comprises of 16 transistor cells. The SUM and CARRY for this full adder are generated by modified XNOR transistors which is advantageous in terms of voltage degradation.

# 12-T Full Adder 
As the name suggests it was introduced to reduce the area, however it resulted in increased delay pin-to-pin delays. The full adder design consists of three modules: Module I employs a 6-transistor (6T) XOR/XNOR circuit based on cross-coupled pMOS and nMOS structures, offering threshold voltage loss reduction through feedback loops. Module II uses pass-transistor logic (PTL) with two transistors to generate the Sum output efficiently with low static power dissipation. Module III utilizes transmission gate logic, combining complementary pMOS and nMOS pairs to produce the Carry output while overcoming voltage degradation issues.

# **Simulation Results**

To analyse various performance parameters, simulation has been conducted on GPDK 180nm technology using Cadence simulation tools. The post-layout simulation was carried out using the Analog Design Environment-L for the av-extracted view. Consequently, the worst case delay, average power dissipation and Power-Delay product were calculated at 1.2V (normal operating voltage), as tabulated below:

From the simulation results, we conclude that the average power dissipation is lowest for TFA with a transistor count of 16 with an appreciable delay of 15.393 ns. The best PDP so far is that of the TFA (16-T) with a value of 98.053 fJ.
